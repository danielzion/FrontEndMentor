## Overview
I began learning Frontend. So my mentor Mr. Tope reffered me to Frontendmentor.io to complete the challenge
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

    position: fixed;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

The entire js
